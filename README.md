# Fresh Proxy Script
## By Brendan Frisby
----------------------------------

#### This is a script I made to keep fresh proxies setup to be used with Proxychains-ng. 


<ul>
<li>
Configured to use random_chain setting intentionally 
</li>
<li>
Slightly higher TCP timeout and connect settings. About 20% higher than default 
</li>
<li>
2000-3000 Fresh Proxies
</li>
</ul>

Thank you for maintaining this repo of fresh proxies.

## **TODO**
---------
- Add something to test the proxies and filter out the non working ones ultimately creating a better list
